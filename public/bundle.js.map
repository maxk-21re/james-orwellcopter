These values are calculated by evaluating the composite expression for\n *    the given feature at strategically chosen zoom levels. In addition to this\n *    attribute data, we also use a uniform value which the shader uses to interpolate\n *    between the min and max value at the final displayed zoom level.

This step populates:\n *      `this.symbolInstances`: metadata on generated symbols\n *      `this.collisionBoxArray`: collision data for use by foreground\n *      `this.text`: SymbolBuffers for text symbols\n *      `this.icons`: SymbolBuffers for icons\n *      `this.collisionBox`: Debug SymbolBuffers for collision boxes\n *      `this.collisionCircle`: Debug SymbolBuffers for collision circles\n *    The results are sent to the foreground for rendering\n *\n * 4. performSymbolPlacement(bucket, collisionIndex) is run on the foreground,\n *    and uses the CollisionIndex along with current camera settings to determine\n *    which symbols can actually show on the map. Collided symbols are hidden\n *    using a dynamic \"OpacityVertexArray\".\n *\n * @private\n */\nclass SymbolBucket implements Bucket {\n    static MAX_GLYPHS: number;\n    static

Some labels have corresponding line geometries.\n * The points for both anchors and lines are stored in tile units. Each tile has it's own\n * coordinate space going from (0, 0) at the top left to (EXTENT, EXTENT) at the bottom right.\n *\n * ## GL coordinate space\n * At the end of everything, the vertex shader needs to produce a position in GL coordinate space,\n * which is (-1, 1) at the top left and (1, -1) in the bottom right.\n *\n * ## Map pixel coordinate spaces\n * Each tile has a pixel coordinate space.

map on your page. It exposes methods\n * and properties that enable you to programmatically change the map,\n * and fires events as users interact with it.\n *\n * You create a `Map` by specifying a `container` and other options.\n * Then Mapbox GL JS initializes the map on the page and returns your `Map`\n * object.\n *\n * @extends Evented\n * @param {Object} options\n * @param {HTMLElement|string} options.container The HTML element in which Mapbox GL JS will render the map, or the element's string `id`. The specified element must have no children.\n * @param {number} [options.minZoom=0] The minimum zoom level of the map (0-24).\n * @param {number} [options.maxZoom=22] The maximum zoom level of the map (0-24).\n * @param {Object|string} [options.style] The map's Mapbox style. This must be an a JSON object conforming to\n * the schema described in the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), or a URL to\n * such JSON.\n *\n * To load a style from the Mapbox API, you can use a URL of the form `mapbox://styles/:owner/:style`,\n * where `:owner` is your Mapbox account name and `:style` is the style ID. Or you can use one of the following\n * [the predefined Mapbox styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/):\n *\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v10`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v10`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v10`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/navigation-preview-day-v2`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/navigation-preview-night-v2`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/navigation-guidance-day-v2`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/navigation-guidance-night-v2`\n *\n * Tilesets hosted with Mapbox can be style-optimized if you append `?optimize=true` to the end of your style URL, like `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9?optimize=true`.\n * Learn more about style-optimized vector tiles in our [API documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#retrieve-tiles).\n *\n * @param {boolean} [options.hash=false] If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.\n *   For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.interactive=true] If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners will be attached to the map, so it will not respond to interaction.\n * @param {number} [options.bearingSnap=7] The threshold, measured in degrees, that determines when the map's\n *   bearing will snap to north. For example, with a `bearingSnap` of 7, if the user rotates\n *   the map within 7 degrees of north, the map will automatically snap to exact north.\n * @param {boolean} [options.pitchWithRotate=true] If `false`, the map's pitch (tilt) control with \"drag to rotate\" interaction will be disabled.\n * @param {number} [options.clickTolerance=3] The max number of pixels a user can shift the mouse pointer during a click for it to be considered a valid click (as opposed to a mouse drag).\n * @param {boolean} [options.attributionControl=true] If `true`, an {@link AttributionControl} will be added to the map.\n * @param {string | Array<string>} [options.customAttribution] String or strings to show in an {@link AttributionControl}. Only applicable if `options.attributionControl` is `true`.\n * @param {string} [options.logoPosition='bottom-left'] A string representing the position of the Mapbox wordmark on the map. Valid options are `top-left`,`top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat=false] If `true`, map creation will fail if the performance of Mapbox\n *   GL JS would be dramatically worse than expected (i.e. a software renderer would be used).\n * @param {boolean} [options.preserveDrawingBuffer=false] If `true`, the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.\n * @param {boolean} [options.refreshExpiredTiles=true] If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.\n * @param {LngLatBoundsLike} [options.maxBounds] If set, the map will be constrained to the given bounds.\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.scrollZoom=true] If `true`, the \"scroll to zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link ScrollZoomHandler#enable}.\n * @param {boolean} [options.boxZoom=true] If `true`, the \"box zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link BoxZoomHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragRotate=true] If `true`, the \"drag to rotate\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragRotateHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragPan=true] If `true`, the \"drag to pan\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragPanHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.keyboard=true] If `true`, keyboard shortcuts are enabled (see {@link KeyboardHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.doubleClickZoom=true] If `true`, the \"double click to zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DoubleClickZoomHandler}).\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.touchZoomRotate=true] If `true`, the \"pinch to rotate and zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link TouchZoomRotateHandler#enable}.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trackResize=true]  If `true`, the map will automatically resize when the browser window resizes.\n * @param {LngLatLike} [options.center=[0, 0]] The inital geographical centerpoint of the map. If `center` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `[0, 0]` Note: Mapbox GL uses longitude, latitude coordinate order (as opposed to latitude, longitude) to match GeoJSON.\n * @param {number} [options.zoom=0] The initial zoom level of the map. If `zoom` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.bearing=0] The initial bearing (rotation) of the map, measured in degrees counter-clockwise from north. If `bearing` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.pitch=0] The initial pitch (tilt) of the map, measured in degrees away from the plane of the screen (0-60). If `pitch` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {LngLatBoundsLike} [options.bounds] The initial bounds of the map. If `bounds` is specified, it overrides `center` and `zoom` constructor options.\n * @param {boolean} [options.renderWorldCopies=true]  If `true`, multiple copies of the world will be rendered, when zoomed out.\n * @param {number} [options.maxTileCacheSize=null]  The maximum number of tiles stored in the tile cache for a given source. If omitted, the cache will be dynamically sized based on the current viewport.\n * @param {string} [options.localIdeographFontFamily=null] If specified, defines a CSS font-family\n *   for locally overriding generation of glyphs in the 'CJK Unified Ideographs' and 'Hangul Syllables' ranges.\n *   In these ranges, font settings from the map's style will be ignored, except for font-weight keywords (light/regular/medium/bold).\n *   The purpose of this option is to avoid bandwidth-intensive glyph server requests. (see [Use locally generated ideographs](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/local-ideographs))\n * @param {RequestTransformFunction} [options.transformRequest=null] A callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.\n *   Expected to return an object with a `url` property and optionally `headers` and `credentials` properties.\n * @param {boolean} [options.collectResourceTiming=false] If `true`, Resource Timing API information will be collected for requests made by GeoJSON and Vector Tile web workers (this information is normally inaccessible from the main Javascript thread). Information will be returned in a `resourceTiming` property of relevant `data` events.\n * @param {number} [options.fadeDuration=300] Controls the duration of the fade-in/fade-out animation for label collisions, in milliseconds. This setting affects all symbol layers. This setting does not affect the duration of runtime styling transitions or raster tile cross-fading.\n * @param {boolean} [options.crossSourceCollisions=true] If `true`, symbols from multiple sources can collide with each other during collision detection. If `false`, collision detection is run separately for the symbols in each source.\n * @example\n * var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n *   container: 'map',\n *   center: [-122.420679, 37.772537],\n *   zoom: 13,\n *   style: style_object,\n *   hash: true,\n *   transformRequest: (url, resourceType)=> {\n *     if(resourceType === 'Source' && url.startsWith('http://myHost')) {\n *       return {\n *        url: url.replace('http', 'https'),\n *        headers: { 'my-custom-header': true},\n *        credentials: 'include'  // Include cookies for cross-origin requests\n *      }\n *     }\n *   }\n * });\n * @see [Display a map](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/)\n */\nclass Map extends Camera {\n    style: Style;\n    painter: Painter;\n\n    _container: HTMLElement;\n

If\n * geolocation support is not available, the GeolocateControl will not\n * be visible.\n *\n * The zoom level applied will depend on the accuracy of the geolocation provided by the device.\n *\n * The GeolocateControl has two modes. If `trackUserLocation` is `false` (default) the control acts as a button, which when pressed will set the map's camera to target the user location. If the user moves, the map won't update. This is most suited for the desktop. If `trackUserLocation` is `true` the control acts as a toggle button that when active the user's location is actively monitored for changes. In this mode the GeolocateControl has three states:\n * * active - the map's camera automatically updates as the user's location changes, keeping the location dot in the center.\n * * passive - the user's location dot automatically updates, but the map's camera does not.\n * * disabled\n *\n * @implements {IControl}\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {Object} [options.positionOptions={enableHighAccuracy: false, timeout: 6000}] A Geolocation API [PositionOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PositionOptions) object.\n * @param {Object} [options.fitBoundsOptions={maxZoom: 15}] A [`fitBounds`](#Map#fitBounds) options object to use when the map is panned and zoomed to the user's location. The default is to use a `maxZoom` of 15 to limit how far the map will zoom in for very accurate locations.\n * @param {Object} [options.trackUserLocation=false] If `true` the Geolocate Control becomes a toggle button and when active the map will receive updates to the user's location as it changes.\n * @param {Object} [options.showUserLocation=true] By default a dot will be shown on the map at the user's location. Set to `false` to disable.\n *\n * @example\n * map.addControl(new mapboxgl.GeolocateControl({\n *     positionOptions: {\n *         enableHighAccuracy: true\n *     },\n *     trackUserLocation:

It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```javascript\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```javascript\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n   * .subscribe(\n   *   function(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   function() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```javascript\n   * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n   * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n   *\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.\n * ```javascript\n * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { observeOn } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const intervals = interval(10);                // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                                // with async scheduler by default...\n * intervals.pipe(\n *   observeOn(animationFrameScheduler),          // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * )                                              // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n * .subscribe(val => {\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {SchedulerLike} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn<T>(scheduler: SchedulerLike, delay: number = 0): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source: Observable<T>): Observable<T> {\n    return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n  };\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private scheduler: SchedulerLike, private delay: number = 0) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  /** @nocollapse */\n  static dispatch(this: SchedulerAction<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\n    notification.observe(destination);\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private scheduler: SchedulerLike,\n              private delay: number = 0) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\n    const destination = this.destination as Subscription;\n    destination.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\n      this.delay,\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\n    ));\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\n  }\n}\n","let nextHandle = 1;\n\nconst tasksByHandle: { [handle: string]: () => void } = {};\n\nfunction runIfPresent(handle: number) {\n  const cb = tasksByHandle[handle];\n  if (cb) {\n    cb();\n  }\n}\n\nexport const Immediate = {\n  setImmediate(cb: () => void): number {\n    const handle = nextHandle++;\n    tasksByHandle[handle] = cb;\n    Promise.resolve().then(() => runIfPresent(handle));\n    return handle;\n  },\n\n  clearImmediate(handle: number): void {\n    delete tasksByHandle[handle];\n  },\n};\n","import { Immediate } from '../util/Immediate';\nimport { AsyncAction } from './AsyncAction';\nimport { AsapScheduler } from './AsapScheduler';\nimport { SchedulerAction } from '../types';\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class AsapAction<T> extends AsyncAction<T> {\n\n  constructor(protected scheduler: AsapScheduler,\n              protected work: (this: SchedulerAction<T>, state?: T) => void) {\n    super(scheduler, work);\n  }\n\n  protected requestAsyncId(scheduler: AsapScheduler, id?: any, delay: number = 0): any {\n    // If delay is greater than 0, request as an async action.\n    if (delay !== null && delay > 0) {\n      return super.requestAsyncId(scheduler, id, delay);\n    }\n    // Push the action to the end of the scheduler queue.\n    scheduler.actions.push(this);\n    // If a microtask has already been scheduled, don't schedule another\n    // one.
